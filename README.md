# Multithreaded Job System

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a reusable multithreaded job system in C++. The system is designed to handle multiple files and parallel jobs efficiently while ensuring thread synchronization to prevent common concurrency issues such as race conditions and deadlocks. Additionally, a parsing system is built to analyze errors and warnings, outputting them in a hierarchical JSON file format.

## Introduction
Multithreading is crucial for developing high-performance applications that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. This project aims to create a robust multithreaded job system in C++ that can manage parallel job execution across multiple files. The system ensures safe thread synchronization and provides a comprehensive error/warning analysis tool, outputting results in a structured JSON format.

## Features
- **Multithreaded Job Execution:** Efficiently handle and execute multiple jobs in parallel.
- **Thread Synchronization:** Prevents race conditions and deadlocks, ensuring safe and reliable operation.
- **Error/Warning Parsing:** Analyzes and parses errors and warnings, outputting results in a hierarchical JSON file.
- **Scalable Design:** Capable of handling multiple files and parallel jobs with ease.

## Usage
To use the multithreaded job system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Multithreaded-Job-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Multithreaded-Job-System
   ```

3. **Build the Project:**
   Use your preferred build system (e.g., Make, CMake) to compile the project. For example, using CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Job System:**
   Execute the compiled binary to start the multithreaded job system. Ensure that you have the necessary input files in the correct format.
   ```bash
   ./multithreaded_job_system
   ```

## Results
The system outputs the results of the job execution, including any errors or warnings, in a hierarchical JSON file. This structured format allows for easy parsing and analysis of the results, facilitating debugging and performance tuning.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the development of a multithreaded job system in C++. By implementing robust thread synchronization mechanisms and a comprehensive error/warning parsing system, the project provides a reliable and scalable solution for managing parallel job execution. The insights gained from this project can be applied to various domains requiring high-performance multithreading capabilities.
